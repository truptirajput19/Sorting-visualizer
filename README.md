# Sorting-visualizer
A sorting visualizer is a tool or program that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by animating the process of rearranging elements in a collection into a specific order. It helps users understand and visualize the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms, making it easier to grasp their inner workings and performance.
